Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend work on [date(s)] due to illness. I woke up feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will also make sure to keep you updated on my progress.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Meghana Reddy
