Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my concern and frustration regarding the freezing of my bank account with Kotak Mahindra Bank. I have been a loyal customer of the bank for several years, and I have never had any issues with my account until now.

I received a notification from the bank stating that my account has been frozen due to "suspicious activity." I was not provided with any further details or explanation for this decision. I have never engaged in any illegal or fraudulent activity, and I am confident that there is no legitimate reason for my account to be frozen.

As a result of the freeze, I am unable to access my funds or make any transactions. This has caused me considerable inconvenience and hardship, as I rely on my bank account for my daily expenses and financial obligations. I have tried to contact the bank to resolve this issue, but I have not been able to get a clear answer or a timeline for when my account will be unfrozen.

I respectfully request that you review my account and lift the freeze as soon as possible. I am happy to provide any additional information or documentation that you may require to verify my identity and my account activity. I am confident that there is no valid reason for my account to be frozen, and I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
