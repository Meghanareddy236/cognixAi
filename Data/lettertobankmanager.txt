Dear Bank Manager,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today to bring to your attention a matter that has been causing me some concern.

I have been a loyal customer of your bank for several years now, and I have always been happy with the level of service and professionalism that I have received. However, recently, I have noticed some discrepancies in my account statements that I cannot explain.

I have double-checked all of my transactions and receipts, and I am certain that there are some errors in the statements that I have received. I would greatly appreciate it if you could look into this matter and provide me with an explanation for these discrepancies.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but as a customer, I have a right to accurate and transparent information about my account. I would also like to take this opportunity to request a meeting with you to discuss my concerns and any potential solutions.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Meghana Reddy
