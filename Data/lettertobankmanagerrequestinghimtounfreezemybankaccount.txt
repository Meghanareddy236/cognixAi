Subject: Urgent Request to Unfreeze Bank Account

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you to request your urgent assistance in unfreezing my bank account, which has been unexpectedly frozen.

My account number is [Your Account Number], and it was frozen on [Date of Freeze]. I was informed of this by a bank representative, who stated that the account was frozen due to suspicious activity. However, I was not provided with any further details regarding the nature of the suspicious activity or the steps I need to take to have the account unfrozen.

I would like to assure you that I have not engaged in any illegal or fraudulent activity and that the funds in my account are from legitimate sources. I am a responsible account holder and have always complied with the bank's policies and procedures. I am confident that there has been some mistake or misunderstanding, and I would be grateful if you could look into this matter and provide me with further information.

The freezing of my account has caused me significant inconvenience and hardship. I rely on this account for my daily expenses, including paying bills, purchasing groceries, and other essential needs. I am unable to access my funds, which has resulted in a number of financial difficulties for me.

I would be grateful if you could expedite the process of unfreezing my account as soon as possible. I am willing to provide any additional information or documentation that you may require to resolve this matter. I would also be happy to meet with you in person to discuss the situation and find a prompt resolution.

Thank you for your time and attention, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Meghana Reddy
