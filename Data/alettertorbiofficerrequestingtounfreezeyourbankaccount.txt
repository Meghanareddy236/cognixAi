Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request your kind assistance in unfreezing my bank account with your esteemed institution. I am a Meghana Reddy, and my account number is XXXXXXXXXX.

I was informed that my account was frozen due to suspicious activity, and I would like to assure you that it was a genuine transaction. I have provided all the necessary documents and explanations to the bank officials, but unfortunately, the account remains frozen.

I assure you that I have taken all necessary precautions to secure my account and will continue to do so in the future. I request you to review my case and lift the freeze on my account at the earliest.

I would be grateful for your prompt attention and action in this matter. Please find attached the necessary documents and details for your reference.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Meghana Reddy
