Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request an increase in the limit of my bank account. I have been a loyal customer of your bank for several years now and have always maintained a good relationship with the bank.

I have recently started a new business venture and my financial needs have increased significantly. I find that the current limit on my account is not sufficient to meet my business requirements. I would greatly appreciate it if you could consider increasing the limit on my account.

I assure you that I have a good credit history and have always been prompt in my payments. I am confident that I will be able to maintain the increased limit without any difficulties.

I would be grateful if you could look into this matter at your earliest convenience. I am enclosing a copy of my account statement and other relevant documents for your perusal.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Meghana Reddy
