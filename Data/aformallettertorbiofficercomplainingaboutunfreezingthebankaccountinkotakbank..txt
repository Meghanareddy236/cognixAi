Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration regarding the unfreezing of my bank account with Kotak Mahindra Bank. I had previously contacted your office to request that my account be frozen due to suspicious activity, and I was assured that the matter would be investigated and addressed.

However, I have recently received a notification from the bank stating that my account has been unfrozen. I am concerned and upset about this decision, as I had not been informed or consulted prior to the unfreezing of my account. I had requested that the account remain frozen until a thorough investigation had been conducted, and I do not believe that this has occurred.

I am once again unable to access my funds or make any transactions, and I am concerned about the security and integrity of my account. I had hoped that the freeze would provide an opportunity for the bank to identify and address any potential issues, but I now fear that my account may be at risk.

I respectfully request that you review this matter and take appropriate action to ensure the security of my account. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this issue, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
