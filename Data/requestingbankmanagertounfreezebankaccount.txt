Dear Bank Manager,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance in unfreezing my bank account. I understand that the account was frozen due to suspicious activity, but I would like to assure you that it was a misunderstanding.

I have been a loyal customer of your bank for several years now and have always maintained a good relationship with your institution. I am aware of the rules and regulations regarding bank accounts and have never intentionally violated any of them.

I recently made a large deposit into my account, which may have triggered the freeze. However, I can provide documentation and proof of the source of the funds. I would be happy to meet with you or provide any additional information that you may require to resolve this issue.

I am experiencing financial hardship as a result of the frozen account, and I would greatly appreciate your help in getting it unfrozen as soon as possible. I understand that your priority is to protect the interests of your customers and the bank, and I assure you that I have no intention of causing any harm.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Meghana Reddy
